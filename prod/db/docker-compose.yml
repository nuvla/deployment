# This Dockerfile provides a single-node deployment of Elasticsearch,
# which will be sufficient for most use cases.
#

# You should review Elasticsearch recommendations (especially the
# resource requirements) to update this Dockerfile for your production
# configuration.  Elasticsearch generally recommends 16 GB of RAM per
# instance, although it will run with significantly less.
